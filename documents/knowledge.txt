Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models.
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
Reinforcement learning trains agents through rewards and punishments.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks.
